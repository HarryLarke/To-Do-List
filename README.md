Hello There! 

Have a look and feel free to make any comments you like about my little To Do List project. It ain't much but it's honest work... 

Apologies, the for the lack of earlier verions. It would have been nice to show the whole process, but my git push'ing' went a bit strange when I used the built in Git Hub push interface on VS code. 

Anyway, have a look, and I will probably mess around with the design and content over the next few days and weeks. 
The goal now is make the programme dry'er' and the design sleeker, whilst working on some other projects.


Thanks Harry ðŸš€
